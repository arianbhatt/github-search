# Github Search Tool

## Overview

I made this script because I was too lazy to type out the whole links or to open a browser to search for github repositories that I want.

## Features 

Nothing in genral actually 
The Tool uses few basic Linux commands and tools to search for repositories.

- git

- sed
- grep

sudo make
```
```sh
sudo make install
```
